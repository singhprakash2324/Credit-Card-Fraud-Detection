# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to non-fraudulent transactions, making this an imbalanced classification problem.
We use Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict fraud, applying SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
